And it&rsquo;s true, any decisions made early are at risk of becoming waste if requirements or technical direction change. So just-in-time design decisions are more agile and less wasteful than traditional upfront architecture. But unfortunately, there still are and always will be dramatic differences in skill levels of developers and their abilities to make important high-level design decisions. And while many proficient developers have adopted agile methods, wider adoption of agile processes and techniques will lead back to the division of labor that separated architects from developers to begin with. So how does architecture fit into agile processes in a way that allows agile practices to scale out across a large organization?","PostDate":"2011-02-25T13:39:47","Id":538.0,"Mp4Video":"http://usergrouptv.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20110225_agile06.mp4","Mp4VideoLow":"http://videos.videopress.com/x7pY48te/20110225_agile06_dvd.mp4","OgvVideo":"http://videos.videopress.com/x7pY48te/20110225_agile06_fmt1.ogv","Speakers":[{"Name":"Todd Girvin","Slug":"todd-girvin"}],"Groups":[{"Name":"Agile .NET","Slug":"agile-net"}],"Tags":[{"Name":"Agile","Slug":"agile"}]},{"Title":"Closing Keynote - Implementing Scrum With VS 2010","Url":"http://usergroup.tv/videos/closing-keynote-implementing-scrum-with-vs-2010","Thumbnail":"http://usergroup.tv/images/20110225_agile07_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg","Exceprt":"Scrum teams often discover that sticky note Scrum boards is a fun, functional, and low cost way to track and broadcast the state of a Scrum project.

NuGet allows you to not only search through an ever-expanding catalog of application packages but also to discover new ones that can help you and your team be more productive. In this session, we’ll start by discussing package management from a high level, move on to installing, configuring and using NuGet form within the IDE and finally we’ll discuss how you can build your very own NuGet packages and distribute them either through the official NuGet stream or your own private repository.

Even Microsoft MVPs, who are privileged to product information earlier than most were surprised by the release of the new search engine. Well, Bing really does seem to be holding its own and even standing out above other engines in many ways. But part of the great thing about a search engine is the ability for us to leverage them from beyond just the web browser. I of course refer to the ability to access their services from our own applications. Bing exposes a great API to do just that, and I don't mean just the simple ability to perform text searches. I also refer to image, video, and many specialty searches. In this session, I'll show you how to access the Bing API and perform all its great functionality from within your own applications, and I'll do this using another great Microsoft technology, WCF. WCF has the ability to act upon both SOAP and REST so it's great for not only writing APIs but for consuming outside APIs as well. Come see how. And as a bonus, maybe I'll wrap some of this stuff into some custom controls too.","PostDate":"2011-08-13T02:00:26","Id":135.0,"Mp4Video":"http://usergrouptv.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20110813_2_miguelcastro.mp4","Mp4VideoLow":"http://videos.videopress.com/EyzhaIOz/20110813_2_miguelcastro_dvd.mp4","OgvVideo":"http://videos.videopress.com/EyzhaIOz/20110813_2_miguelcastro_fmt1.ogv","Speakers":[{"Name":"Miguel Castro","Slug":"miguel-castro"}],"Groups":[{"Name":"Dallas TechFest 2011","Slug":"dallas-techfest-2011"}],"Tags":[{"Name":"Bing","Slug":"bing"}]},{"Title":"ASP.NET MVC 3 In Action","Url":"http://usergroup.tv/videos/asp-net-mvc-3-in-action","Thumbnail":"http://usergroup.tv/images/20110813_3_matthinze_scruberthumbnail_1.jpg","Exceprt":"This talk is for developers familiar with ASP.NET MVC that are taking their use of the framework to the next level.

Desktops, servers, smart phones, tablets, and even some lesser-known embedded devices are built with multiple cores. After giving up on advancing with one core for processor speed due to heat issues, hardware manufacturers have focused on building multi-core CPUs and putting two, four, eight, or even more cores on a processor.</p>\n<p>Obviously, utilizing these cores in the best form is a vital task to take the most out of the available hardware and this has driven the research and investments in computer architecture, programming language, and compiler design communities to facilitate the process of programming for multiple cores. However, there are some fundamental issues involved with this task that make it difficult. Computer architects have been able to solve the problems with hardware, however, the problems on the software side are difficult enough that this field is now one of the primary areas of research and investment both at academia and industry. Recent versions of programming languages and compilers have added many new features to enable concurrency and simplify that, and .NET Framework 4.0 was not an exception.</p>\n<p>These trends in the software world will eventually drive the programming community to a point where programmers need to deal with concurrency more seriously in action. Therefore, the professional programmer of future will need great skills and deep understanding of parallel programming to succeed.</p>\n<p>In this session we discover different aspects of parallel programming. This session consists of two main parts: in the first part, we introduce the concepts and principles of parallel programming and the main challenges involved in writing concurrent code, and in the second part, we apply these concepts in action using the .NET Framework to see what features are provided to facilitate parallel programming.

HierarchyID CLR Data Type Presentation. Michael Kappel talks about HierarchyIDs including what they are, how to use them, when to use them, and also when not to. Microsoft has made implementing parent-child relationships faster and simpler to implement successfully through the new native support of hierarchical data in SQL Server 2008. The HierarchyID is a common language runtime (CLR) data type and because of this Microsoft was able to build in a number of methods to make traversing nodes simple. Initial setup and configuration of the HierarchyID data type can seem tricky and confusing at first. Especially with real work situations like having multiple root nodes or both branch and root nodes simultaneously. In this demonstration I will setup and implement standard node branching as well as Multi-root and tree branch/root combinations for advanced hierarchical data scenarios. HierarchyID is a powerful solution to Parent, Child, Ancestor, Descendent, and Sibling data management. The true genius of the HierarchyID data type is simple and flexible design that is shockingly fast in node related quires.","PostDate":"2011-11-02T02:07:51","Id":139.0,"Mp4Video":"http://usergrouptv.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20110820_michaelkappel.mp4","Mp4VideoLow":"http://videos.videopress.com/oExOk9mV/20110820_michaelkappel_dvd.mp4","OgvVideo":"http://videos.videopress.com/oExOk9mV/20110820_michaelkappel_fmt1.ogv","Speakers":[{"Name":"Michael Kappel","Slug":"michael-kappel"}],"Groups":[{"Name":"Chicago IT Architects Group","Slug":"citag"}],"Tags":[{"Name":"HierarchyID","Slug":"hierarchyid"}]},{"Title":"Algorithms and Patterns in C# .NET","Url":"http://usergroup.tv/videos/algorithms-and-patterns-in-c-net","Thumbnail":"http://usergroup.tv/images/20111102_chanderdhall_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg","Exceprt":"Why are right algorithms and patterns are so vital to the robustness of your application?

At the end the group will be rewarded by a sight of a mouse and keyboard working by themselves, testing the UI automatically while we are relaxing with a pizza.","PostDate":"2012-03-14T13:01:38","Id":638.0,"Mp4Video":"http://usergrouptv.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/20120405_rathonhenehanrajan.mp4","Mp4VideoLow":"http://videos.videopress.com/3KaU1xbi/20120405_rathonhenehanrajan_dvd.mp4","OgvVideo":"http://videos.videopress.com/3KaU1xbi/20120405_rathonhenehanrajan_fmt1.ogv","Speakers":[{"Name":"Sergey Rathon","Slug":"sergey-rathon"},{"Name":"Ian Henehan","Slug":"ian-henehan"}],"Groups":[{"Name":"Dallas C# SIG","Slug":"dallas-c-sig"}],"Tags":[{"Name":"Selenium","Slug":"selenium"},{"Name":"Test","Slug":"test"}]},{"Title":"ASP.NET WebAPI","Url":"http://usergroup.tv/videos/asp-net-webapi","Thumbnail":"http://usergroup.tv/images/20130314_shawnweisfeld_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg","Exceprt":"I know that your app needs to move data between the client and server.
